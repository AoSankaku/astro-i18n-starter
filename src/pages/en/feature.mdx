## Components

Inside `src/components/i18n/`, you will find several UI components that are useful for generating multilingual sites. Feel free to customize their content and import them as needed.

### LocaleSelect.astro
A select UI for switching between languages.

### LocaleSelectSingle.astro
A link UI to another language. Use this when you only support two languages.

### LocalesHomeList.astro
Returns a list of links to the top pages of each language, wrapped in `<li>` tags.

### LocaleSuggest.astro
Displays a UI at the top suggesting a link to the browser's language when the user accesses a URL different from their browser's language.

For example, if a user with English settings accesses the URL `/ja/[slug]`, it suggests a link to `/en/[slug]`.

Once closed, the setting is saved on localhost and will not be displayed again.

### LocaleHtmlHead.astro
Allows you to specify `<head>` tag settings for each locale. The sample code loads the [Noto Font](https://fonts.google.com/noto/) for each language and applies the CSS.

### NotTranslateCaution.astro
Displays a warning to the user when a specific page is only available in a certain language.

The sample page is [Monolingual](/monolingual/). When this page is viewed in a language other than English, it displays a warning UI to the user.

The text for the warning UI is set in `/src/const.ts` in the sample code.



## 404

The { SITE_TITLE } 404 page consists of two files. If you want to customize the design of the 404 page, you generally only need to edit `src/pages/[lang]/404.astro`.

### src/pages/404.astro

This file generates the following:

> /404.html

Most deploy services will find and use this file when a page is not found.

When accessed with { SITE_TITLE }, it redirects to the following 404 page based on the user's system language:

### src/pages/[lang]/404.astro

This file dynamically generates the following:

> * /en/404/index.html
> * /ja/404/index.html
> * ...

Actually, by `history.replaceState()` process displays the URL the user accessed before the redirect in the browser
